roaming inbetween the worlds of
sleep and awake
seems so far away from where
i've been and unsure but
unafraid
intrusting --my soul--
i know i must
be taken to see the world
that is
not so far from now
imaginations come and sweep the
shores of my mind
letting it be, visions pass,
and emotions arise---
letting them go, and beyond are
doors I've never seen,
opening one by one
(wake up)
i hear a voice, hear a voice
calling out to me
(wake up)
look inside, see the light
now ever holding you
all the truth is all you need
to make up your reality,
its right here
look deep within your shell
finding out a galaxy of planets
and stars within me
listening to each of them
singing the same silent melody
i've never seen such beauty
in possibility--
no speck of doubt or fear
(wake up)
i hear a voice, hear a voice
calling out to me
(wake up)
i see inside, see the light now
ever holding me
all the truth, all i need to
make up this reality it's--
beauty within the shell
(wake up)
i hear a voice, hear a voice
calling out to me
(wake up)
i see inside, see the light now
ever holding me
all the truth, all i need to
make up this reality,
it's inside
right here within this shell
the sandglass starts for
another time's beginning
from within
cotton fields, mama's arms are
gently unfolding me
into the new...
(wake up)
show the light
(wake up)
the time is right
here from behind my sight,
my thoughts my mind
show the light
the time is right
and from the depth within
show the balance
of outer and inner harmony
mind and heart,
soul and spirit undivided
here's where teh true strength
and beauty lies
we'll see this before us with
our own eyes
we'll see, with our own
eyes... LOVE
(wake up)
i hear a voice, hear a voice
calling out to me
(wake up)
i see inside, see the light now
ever holding me
all the truth, all i need to
make of this reality it's--
the beauty within the shell
(wake up)
i hear a voice, hear a voice
calling out to me
(wake up)
i see inside, see the light now
ever holding me
all the truth, all i need to
make up this reality it's inside
right here within the shell
(wake up)
i hear a voice calling out to me
I see inside, the light now
ever holding me
all the truth, all i need to
make up this reality it's inside
deep within the shell,
within the shell
wake up and show the light,
wake up the time is right...
i hear a voice,
calling out to me
wake up
